</div>
<p>First... <a href="https://github.com/mikeoverbay/PKGexplorer" class="style2">Get this tool!</a> PGK Explorer makes it a snap to search and extract models and other data from the world of tanks PKG files.<br />
  <br />
Once you have that.. find a model you would like to load in Tank Exporter and extract its data<br />
Here is a video showing the basic use of PKG Exporter.</p>

  <br/>
Most of the features in Tank Exporter work with stand alone primitives.<br />
Obviously, features to work with the tanks such as hiding each tank component is not going to function.<br />
You can use the hide panel however.. Press 'V' to show the hide/show control panel.<br />
Stand alone primitives also have no Blend Bone pins or vertex colors that are used in Tank Exporter.</p>
<p> In order to export the textures along with the models, Tank Exporter creates special textures mixed from the atlas textures.<br />
  The textures generated are large 4096 x 4096 PNG files. Anything less and the quality us unacceptable.<br />
Not all components of a primitive set use atlas textures.. Those regular textures are exported unchanged.<br />
The reason Tank Exporter creates these custom textures is because exporting the atlas textures is unusable.<br />
Exporting these custom textures with the FBX can take a bit of time depending on the speed of your computer.<br />
Tank Exporter now allows converting the normal maps in to standard tangent maps all 3D apps use.<br />
Also, you have an option to create a texture for each model or one shared texture.<br />
You may need to split off textures by model if the have overlapping UV mapping.
</p>
<p>Tank Exporter will search the PKG files for files that are missing that it needs to load the primitive.<br />
This can take some time.. Just let Tank Exporter run until it finds and loads all data for the primitives.</p>
<p><span class="style2">Tank Exporter can NOT write primitives of stand alone primitives as of now! It will probably crash TE if you try. <br />
</span><br /> 
Here is a sample of a bunker primitive model loaded in Tank Exporter...</p>
