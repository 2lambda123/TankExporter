<p class="style1">Lets Change Something!</p>
<p>Now that you know you can export and import a tank in to Tank Export and the scaling is correct, it's time to do some editing.</p>
<ul>
  <p>Now that you know how to  create a FBX and load it in your 3D app.. DO IT!<br />
    Do some simple editing just to get used to a few concepts.<br />
    Here is a list of key things you should know.<br />
  1. The names of each item is VERY important. DO NOT CHANGE THEM! it will break importing the FBX in Tank Exporter.<br />
    2. The helper entries that all the visual markers are layered in to. DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THIS! you can hide anything you want.<br />
    3. You can add lights to the scene. Tank Export ignores these but this is not tested with any app but 3DS Max!<br />
    4. Adding models that are not associated with a tank component will make writing a primitive impossible unless they <span class="style2">contain &quot;clone&quot; in their name</span>.<br />
    5. To associate added geometry to a tank component, add that tank components name to its name. &quot;hull_new_object&quot; for example.<br />
    6. UV COORDINATES can mess things up bad! Every vertex must have a UV assigned to it.<br />
    7. Cleaning up of dead vertices and UVs is critical. The game will crash if there are more UVs than is expected!<br />
    Cleaning up has to be done so often, <a href="http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/user/jldragon-1001893248/">JLdragon</a> has got his hands on a script for Max that does this in one click. The script and instructions are at the bottom of this page.<br />
  8. Vertex Colors control the Chassis and Guns deform in the game. Messing them up can cause unexpected results. There will be more on this in a different process page. <br />
  9. Make sure you set the FBX exporter to write TRIANGLES if you created quads or changing things to quads!<br />
  <br />
  So.. With the model loaded in Max, deleted something off the tanks Hull.. Maybe removes all the fender sheet metal polygons.<br />
  After you have deleted some things and BEFORE you export the FBX, you must clean up the dead vertices left in the model.<br />
  If you don't want to mess with adding a script and button.. these are the steps needed.<br />
  1. Add a Unwrap UVW to the stack. You can get to this under Modifiers on the top menu in Max.<br />
  2. Add 2 Vertex Paint Modifiers. Set one of them so the Channel is Vertex Alpha.<br />
  3. Right Click in the 
  modifier stack panel and than Collapse all.<br />
  After you have cleaned the dead vertices, you can export the FBX.<br />
  <span class="style2">Don't over write the original FBX!</span> Rename the one you export from Max. I usually just add &quot;_Max&quot; to its name. <br />
  <span class="style4">Hint:</span> Under Tools on the top menu in Max, there is one called 
  &quot;Channel Info...&quot;. That tool shows a list of Vertices, UVs and other information about the selected object. </p>
  <p>Import the FBX in to Tank Exporter. You should see a window popup and close very fast.. This is TE updating the check boxes of what it thinks needs to be written to the primitive file. <br />
  On the File/Settings menu, select Write Primitive.<br />
    A window will pop up that looks like this:<br />

        <p>If TE found a difference between the data in the FBX and the PKG files, the check box for that component will be checked.<br />
        You can always check any box you want but <span class="style2">don't write or extract things to the res_mods that have not changed.</span> <span class="style2">Doing so wastes time loading the game.</span></p>
        <p><span class="style2">Flipping </span>the <a href="https://cmichel.io/understanding-front-faces-winding-order-and-normals" target="_blank">Vertex Winding Orde</a>r causes the vertices to be saved in the opposite winding order.<br />

        TE manages this setting based on paths in the FBX. <span class="style2">You should never need to change this setting!<br />
        </span><br />
          You can <span class="style2">hide the tracks</span> on the chassis by checking that box. This should work on all models now.<br />
        <span class="style2">Copy to LODs 1-4</span> will copy the prmitives and visuals from LOD0 to LODS 1-4. Leave this checked. </p>
        <p>Click the <span class="style2">Write File(s)</span> under Upton's lovely left breast once you are ready.<br />

  <p><br/>
    You might get the pop up about extracting if you didn't do it when asked before.. That's fine.. do it now.<br />
    Also.. you can extract to res_mods any time after loading a tank. Be aware that TE will NOT overwrite an existing primitive or texture file.<br />
    <span class="style2">Writing primitive file(s) DOES over write the existing file(s) </span>Extracting does not! <br />
    If you want to clear the folder and write fresh unchanged tank data, use the &quot;Remove Tank From res_mods&quot; menu item.<br />
    You will need to re-extract that tank to res_mods again before being able to write out a primitive. <br />
    Be careful! TE doesn't care about your files when it deletes them.. If you have important work there on textures, BACK THEM UP SOME WHERE SAFE!<br />
  I have done my best to prevent Tank Exporter from destroying work you may have preformed on textures. Use &quot;Remove Tank From res_mods&quot; at your own risk! </p>
  <p>Once you have written the primitive to the res_mods folder, load up the game and check out your newly edited tank.<br />
    If the game crashes, chances are you forgot to clean the dead vertices of one of the parts OR, you have a model that has bad UV mapping.<br />
    These pages are not to teach you how to do UV mapping or edit them. It would take a book full of pages to explain all of it.<br />
  There is plenty of videos and tutorials on the internet that can help you learn UV mapping and other aspects of model editing.<br />
  Getting a good working knowledge of how editing works in Max or any other 3D program is essential to being successful at modding tanks! </p>
