<p class="style1">Tank Exporter allows you to take pictures of the current screen.</p>
<p>After you load a tank or import an FBX, use Screen Capture under the Export/Extract menu item.<br />
The zoom and position of the view effects the saved image.<br />
  Screen Capture only writes PNG files.
</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="263"><img src="Images/screencapture.jpg" alt="Screen Capture" width="335" height="373" /></td>
    <td width="83%"><p>I have given you a nice selection of sizes to save your PNG and also any size you wish to use.<br />
      You should make these custom sizes even numbered. (Divisable by 2).<br />
      Also, there are presets for the World of Tanks image Icons and the Mods Portal cover. <br />
      <br />
        Pick the background type and click Save.<br />
        The Image radio button will allow you to load a image as the background.<br />
        When set, it will ask for the image to load after you select where to save your capture. <br />
        For best results, the image should have the same proprotions of the image size you are capturing.<br />
        <br />
        If you want to create an image for a forum, I recommend using color background and setting the color to match that of the forums.<br />
    The reason for this is anti-aliasing works with colors and not alpha/transparent backgrounds. </p>
