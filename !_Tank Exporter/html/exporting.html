<p class="style1">To export a tank, first load one...</p>
<p> After, on the top menu, under Export/Extract, click on Export FBX.</p>
<p>Select a place to store your FBX. I usually create a work folder on my desktop called &quot;Exported FBX&quot;.<br />
After you chose where to write the FBX to, the FBX Xporter panel will popup. (purposely spelled wrong)</p>

    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Flip U and V can be handy if for some reason the texture mapping is wrong in your 3D editing application.<br />
      Export Textures does what it says.. Leave this checked..<br />
        Tank Exporter will create a sub folder with the name of the tank and place all the textures within it.<br />
      Textures will never be over written when exporting by Tank Exporter.<br />
      This is to protect any changes you make to the PNGs Tank Exporter created.<br />
    Create Binary file.. This forces a binary file to be created. Its much smaller than ASCII but non-man-readable.<br />
    Leave this checked unless you want to try and edit a FBX by hand. (Not recommended). </p>
      <p>Click Export to write out the new FBX file. After, you can import it in your 3D application.</p></td>
