<p class="style1">To export a tank, first load one...</p>
<p> After, on the top menu, under Export/Extract, click on Export FBX.</p>
<p>Select a place to store your FBX. I usually create a work folder on my desktop called &quot;Exported FBX&quot;.<br />
After you chose where to write the FBX to, the FBX Exporter panel will popup. (purposely spelled wrong)</p>

      This format is a work around for Blenders inability to load instanced materials and mesh models.<br /> 
      Blender Compatible FBX files will be larger because they contain a NEW material and a NEW model for every Bend bone pin Marker.<br />
      Read more below....
    </p>
      <p>Flip U and V can be handy if for some reason the texture mapping is wrong in your 3D editing application.<br />
        Convert Normal Maps. This converts the normal maps in to standard tangent maps.<br />
        Flip Y Normal. If bum[ mapping looks upside down, checking this should fix the problem. <br />
        Export Textures does what it says.. Leave this checked..<br />
        Tank Exporter will create a sub folder with the name of the tank and place all the textures within it.<br />
        Textures will never be over written when exporting by Tank Exporter.<br />
        This is to protect any changes you make to the PNGs Tank Exporter created.<br />
        Create Binary file.. This forces a binary file to be created. Its much smaller than ASCII but non-man-readable.<br />
        Leave this checked unless you want to try and edit a FBX by hand. (Not recommended).<br />
        Blender and Spilt Textures check boxes force the exporter to create a texture for each model.<br /> 
        Stand alone primitives FBX export mixes and creates custom texture maps.<br />
        Creating these textures is the only way to display the models textures correctly.<br />
        If UV coordinates cause overlapping textures, checking Split Textures fixes this by creating a new texture for every map.<br />
        This can cause a lot of wasted space on the maps but there is no other solution.<br />
      Do Not Export Markers. Stops the exporting of the Bend Bone markers. </p>
      <p>Click Export to write out the new FBX file. After, you can import it in your 3D application.</p></td>

<p>NOTE: Blender FBX files exported from Tank Exporter can be imported in to other 3D apps such as 3DS Max.<br />
The difference is, there will be a lot of materials. One for each Bend bone pin Marker.</p>
<p><br />
  The current FBX plugin for Blender can NOT import the version of FBX Tank Exporter creates.<br />
  You will need to download <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-converter-archives" target="_blank"><strong>Autodesk's free FBX Converter</strong></a>. Use it to convert Tank Exporter's FBX to version 2013. </p>
<p><span class="style2">Another very serious issue with Blender's FBX plugin is, when importing the materials, by default, the opacity is set to ZERO</span>.<br />
  This does not affect Tank Exporter but other apps will show the materials as transparent.<br />
  FBX Converter's FBX viewer may not show the models! FBX Preview may have issues as well<br /> 
  You need to fix the Alpha in blender 2.79.<br />
  In Blender, You can disable transparency in the windows material setting or edit the materials opacity.<br />
  You can change the ALPHA to 1.0 for each material for the tanks components.<br />
  Blender 2.8 does not have this problem. <br />
