In order to create a packaged wotmod zip file you must first load the tank you wish to create the wotmod from.</p>
  <p> There must be data for this tank in the res_mods folder.<br />
    <br />
  The builder will package these files.<br />
  PNG images of the tank used in the carosusel and panels 60x100  and 420x307 sizes.<br />
   Scripts Tank.xml<br />

  <span class="style2">Any crash tank files are packaged as well. </span></p>
  <p class="style3">Tank Exporter changes paths to resources in visual_processed,<br />
  .model and the tanks xml automatically based on what is in res_mods. </p>
  <p> All data that will be packed in to the wotmod file will come from what is in the res_mods. No where else.<br />
    <br />
    Tank Exporter has a new panel to create the &quot;meta.xml&quot; that will be packaged in the WOTMOD file.<br />
    You only need to enter a name in the &quot;Creator's Name&quot; field!
    TE will fill in the rest for you.<br /> 
    <img src="Images/wotmod_panel.jpg" alt="wotmod panel" width="527" height="218" /><br />
    Click OK and find where the world_of_tanks/mods/currentVersion/ folder.. DONT CHANGE THE SAVED NAME!<br />
    Click Save.... <br />
    After, 
    TE will search every file in the res_mods that is relevant to the loaded tank.<br />
  Any file that contains the tanks name will be included in the wotmod file.<br />
  <br />
  wotmod zips have NO compression. They are store only zip files as it is with all WOT files stored in zips.</p>
