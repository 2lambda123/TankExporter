  <p align="center"><span class="style1">Creating WOTMOD files.</span></p>
  <p><br />
In order to create a packaged wotmod zip file you must first load the tank you wish to create the wotmod from.</p>
  <p> There must be data for this tank in the res_mods folder.<br />
    <br />
  The builder will package these files.<br />
    gui tank PNG (use in the tank carousel) <br />
    scripts Tank.xml<br />
  vehicle data (textures, .model, .visual_processed, .primitive_processed, track segment(s) and .models)<br />
  Any crash tank files are packaged as well. </p>
  <p class="style3">Tank Exporter changes paths to resources in visual_processed,<br />
  .model and the tanks xml automatically based on what is in res_mods. </p>
  <p> All data that will be packed in to the wotmod file will come from what is in the res_mods. No where else.<br />
    <br />
    Tank Exporter has a new panel to create the &quot;meta.xml&quot; that will be packaged in the WOTMOD file.<br />
    You only need to enter a name in the &quot;Creator's Name&quot; field!
    TE will fill in the rest for you.<br /> 
    <br />
    Once you select where you want to save the wotmod file and its name, TE will search every file in the res_mods that is relevant to the loaded tank.<br />
  Any file that contains the tanks name will be included in the wotmod file.<br />
  <br />
  wotmod zips have NO compression. They are store only zip files as it is with all WOT files stored in zips.</p>
  <p><span class="style2">Tip..</span> If you want custom textures for the tracks. Place these new textures in the tanks root folder and change the paths in the chassis.visual_proccesed file.<br />
    This applies to DETAILS textures as well as any textures not normally in the tanks root folder.</p>
