  <p><br />
In order to create a packaged wotmod zip file you must first load the tank you wish to create the wotmod from.</p>
  <p> There must be data for this tank in the res_mods folder.</p>
  <p> All data that will be packed in to the wotmod file will come from what is in the res_mods. No where else.<br />
    <br />
    Once you select where you want to save the wotmod file and its name, TE will search every file in the res_mods that is relevant to the loaded tank.<br />
  Any file that contains the tanks name will be included in the wotmod file. XML config files that reside in the scripts folder will be added if they exist in the res_mods folder.<br />
  <br />
  wotmod zips have NO compression. They are store only zip files as it is with all WOT files stored in zips. </p>
