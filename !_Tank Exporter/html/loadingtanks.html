<p><span class="style2">Loading a tank.</span></p>
<p>This is done by right clicking on a tank in the tier list to the right of the render window.<br />
  A small context window will open with 2 options.. Load This.. and Reload Textures.<br />
  <span class="style2">NOTE:</span><span class="style3"><span class="style4"> If Tank Exporter finds a tank in res_mods, it will load the tank from that location and NOT the PKG files.<br />
  This includes any textures, visual and primitive files. </span></span><span class="style3"><span class="style4">TE does this to preview any geometry or texture changes. </span><br />
  Never export FBX from a tank loaded from the res_mods unless you have NEVER changed the chassis!<br />
  Because of the way Tank Exporter modifies the Chassis.visual_processed file, it loses the changes to the Marker locations.<br />
  Re-exporting a previously modified chassis primitive will break the FBX.

      Click Load This.. to load a tank in to Tank Exporter.<br />
      You can also load the crashed models if you wish.<br />
      Tank Exporter will work exactly the same when exporting and importing FBX files.<br />
      <br />
        Tank exporter will find and loaded every thing it can find that belongs to this tank.<br />
        After this search, a panel will open with a list of items it found for the tank.</p>
      <p align="left">You can also Reload Textures.<br />
      This is handy if you are painting the DDS files and want to preview them in TE</p>
      <p align="left">You can also load the tanks description from the WoT API.<br />
        A window will open showing the info for that tank.
