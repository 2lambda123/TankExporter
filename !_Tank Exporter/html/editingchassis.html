<p class="style1">Editing the Chassis.</p>
<p>A few notes...</p>
<p>In the process, we are using the famous Russian T-54!</p>
<p>Make a folder on your C: root and name it !_T54. The exclamation mark will push it to the top of the listing in windows explore. <br />
  You can NOT change the track section of the model. This is because it has weights that FBX can not export.<br />
  You can edit the carriage section. Its complex and takes a great deal of effort to get things to work in game.</p>
<p>Its easy to delete polygons and entire wheels.<br />
You can rescale wheels and change their geometry as long as you maintain the Vertex Colors that are associated with that wheel.</p>
<p>If you move a wheel from its original location, it will cause the wheel to 'orbit' around its previous center.<br />
  The work around for this problem is moving the Markers.. When you move a marker, it will update the visual about the wheels location.<br />
  JLdragon and myself spent many hours figuring out how to make this work by simple trial and error.
  <br />
  As mentioned before in Visual Markers page, each wheel has a unique vertex color.<br />
  Before attempting to edit the carriage, it is a good idea to use the texture viewer to mouse over the carriage parts to get a better understanding of how the vertex colors work.</p>
<p>The process we have been using to know how a wheel fits, is to clone one of the wheels and parent it to the marker you want to move.<br />
  First.. Let me explain how to split off a clone and a few other things.<br />
  Put the carriage in vertex color view mode.<br />
  Right click on the component in the Layer Explorer window and than click on Properties..<br />
  A window will open with all the properties for that component. Check &quot;Vertex Channel Display&quot; near the bottom left.<br />
  This will force Max to display the vertex colors in the render window. Close the Properties window.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="488" align="right"><img src="Images/carriage_1.jpg" width="488" height="844" /></td>
    <td width="69%" align="left" valign="top"><p>Hide everything but the hull and carriage components.<br />
      Select one of the carriage halfs.. Some models have the entire carriage as one object.<br />
      Go to edit mode (square icon at top of modifier stack as seen in this image).</p>
      <p>Click the Vertex Mode selection icons.. The one with the 3 points in yellow.<br />
        At the bottom of the stack, there is a roll out panel called &quot;Select Vertices By&quot;.<br />
        This is used to select vertices by color. Set the range to 1 in the channels R,G and B.<br />
      Click the color box there.. in this image its white. A color picking window will open.<br />
      <img src="Images/colorpicker.jpg" alt="Color Picker" width="471" height="256" /><br />
      Click the Eye Dropper and click the front right wheel.<br />
      The color should change to what you just picked with the Eye Dropper.<br />
      Now, click on Select at the bottom. This should select all the vertices that match the color.<br />
      <img src="Images/pickedwheelcolors.jpg" alt="Picked Wheel Vertices" width="234" height="206" /><br />
        Go to Detach on the Edit Geometry roll out and click it. Set the values of the window that opens to the same as this image of it. <br />
        <img src="Images/detachasclone.jpg" alt="Clone" width="262" height="146" />        Click OK. <br />
</p>    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Next.. Hide everything but the Hull and the new Object001. Go to its properties and uncheck  &quot;Vertex Channel Display&quot; and close the properties window.<br />
  Find the Marker that sits in the middle of that new cloned wheel. Hide all the other Markers. It should look something like this at this point:<br />
  <img src="Images/wheelandmarker.jpg" alt="Wheel and Marker" width="430" height="288" />  <br />
  Next we want to &quot;Parent the wheel to the Marker&quot;. To do this, drag the object001 in the Layer Exporter and drop it on top of the Marker.<br />
  After it should look like this:<br />
  <img src="Images/parentedwheel.jpg" alt="Parented wheel" width="301" height="132" />  <br />
  Now, When you move the Marker, the wheel will follow!<br />
  We are doing this so we know where to place the Marker in relation to the ground and the tank.<br />
  Its an easy way to know if our wheel will display in game in the right location. Remember.. the Marker controls the wheels location in the game engine!<br />
  Select the Cloned wheel.. go to the modifier stack and select By Element. Select the wheel entire wheel. Drag a box around it.<br />
  <span class="style2">Click and hold the scale button on the top window menu and select the 2nd item down. Also set the scale by center under the ribbon looking icon. </span><br />
  <img src="Images/scalemode.jpg" alt="Scale Mode" width="301" height="132" />  <img src="Images/ribboncenterscale.jpg" alt="Scale center" width="301" height="132" /><br />
  On the bottom of the window in Max, there are 3 places X, Y and Z to type numbers in to.. Type 125.0 in Y and Z. Take note of the scale. You will need it for the other wheels! <br />
  Click anywhere in the window to unselect elements and than unselect By Element in the modifier stack.<br /> 
  The wheel should be a bit bigger now.<br />
Next.. we need to add a plane to the represent the ground. Add a plane at Y zero large enough to cover the area under the tank.<br />
<span class="style2">Change its name to include &quot;Clone&quot; in it. &quot;Clone_Plane001&quot; for example.</span><br />
Now that we know where the Wheel makes contact with the ground, you can move the wheel by moving its parent marker.<br />
Don't move just the wheel.. Remember the Marker controls where the wheel will be displayed in the game!<br />
Press F12 so the position window shows up. Take note of where this Marker is.. You will need it to move the other Marker on the other side!<br />
<span class="style2">Rename the cloned wheel to from &quot;Object001&quot; to &quot;Clone001&quot;. Renaming it so clone is in the name will make Tank Exporter ignore it during FBX import.</span><br />
Note: I failed to select the rims interior so it did not get scaled. Be careful and make sure you have all of the wheel selected!<br />
Your wheel and Marker should look something like this:<br />
<img src="Images/transformedmarkerandwheel.jpg" alt="Transformed Wheel and Marker" width="555" height="282" /><br />
Next.. Hide the wheel and the Marker.. Un hide the carriage on that side with the wheel.<br />
Select the carriage.
  Go to the modifier stack and select By Element.<br />
  Select all but the two out side ground wheels and press delete. Delete the Drive and Idler Wheels at each end of the carriage.<br />
  Make sure you do NOT delete any Markers or anything else but the wheels and the suspension for them.<br />
  Select the wheel we cloned and change its scale to what we did to the cloned copy.. 125 on Y and Z. <span class="style2">DO NOT MOVE IT! </span><br />
  Click anywhere to unselect and than un-select By Element.<br />
  After all this, this side of the tank should look very close to this image!<br />
  <img src="Images/readytoexporttest.jpg" alt="Ready for trial export" width="555" height="282" />  <br />
  The wheel is poking through the ground plane.. That's good and what we want!<br />
We scaled it up but didn't move it! Only the Marker for its location was moved.</p>
<p> Now we are going to test this in the game. <br />
Export everything as an FBX from Max. Add _Max to its name when you export it.<br />
You will get an error about the Plane object.. Planes have no Y thickness so Max will convert it to a mesh.<br />
<span class="style2">If you don't change its name to include &quot;Clone&quot; in it. TE will think you are adding a new model! </span><br /> 
You don't need to un hide anything as TE doesn't care about visibility in a FBX. Other apps do including Max.<br />
  Import the new FBX in Tank Exporter. You will see that the wheel is scaled but its location has not changed.<br />
  <img src="Images/t54tankexporter.jpg" alt="T54 in TE" width="555" height="282" /><br />
  This is because TE does not turn each part of the carriage's wheels in to individual models that can be moved. TE can only show their scale.<br />
  Write the Primitive. (I'm assuming you have followed the previous processes in the help pages and know how to get around in Tank Exporter).<br />
  Check the &quot;Hide Tracks&quot; box and the Chassis box. Tank Exporter should of checked the Chassis box for you. <br />
  Load up the game and see how it displays in World of Tanks.<br />

  If you have any problems, go over the process again. <br />
