<p class="style1">Step one. Get it all working!</p>
<p>Before you dive into creating the worlds greatest tank remodel, lets make sure everything is working.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is...<br />
  Load a tank from the right menu. Find a tank and right click it and than &quot;Load This...&quot;<br />
Once the tank loads, play around with the different view settings.. Textures on/off.. Show Edges.. <br />
Hide parts of the tank.. Changing the back ground.<br />
Check out the Texture viewing and UV mapping display features. Play with the Camouflage if you wish. <br />
Practice moving around in the render window.<br />
Get used to navigating and placing the view cross hair on areas of the tank you want to zoom up on.</p>
<p><span class="style3">Step 1.<br />
</span>Lets export our first FBX file.<br />
  Go to the menu and select Export/Extract and than Export FBX.</p>
<p><em>Do not get Export and Extract confused. Export creates a FBX file.<br />
  Extract 'Extracts&quot; data from the PKG files and places it in the res_mods where the game can load it from.</em></p>
<p>A window will popup asking where you want to export your FBX.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="218"><img src="Images/fbxpanel.jpg" alt="FBX Panel" width="219" height="279" /></td>
    <td width="100%"><p>After you pick where to save and click OK. The FBX Xporter panel will pop up<br />
      If you have issues with Textures being backwards, you can flip either U, V or both.</p>
      <p>Export Textures does what it says. It will create a sub folder to write the textures there under the tanks name.<br />
      Tank Exporter converts from DDS to PNG while saving the textures with the FBX. </p>
      <p>Create Binary writes a much smaller but non-human readable file. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>  <span class="style3">Step 2.</span><br />
  Load up your 3D editing/creation software and import the FBX.<br />
  Export the FBX from that 3D app and save it under a NEW NAME. I usually just add _Max to the end. (I use 3DS Max)</p>
<p><span class="style3">Step 3.</span> <br />
  Import the new FBX in to Tank Exporter.. ( File/Settings --&gt; Import FBX)</p>
<p>Tank Exporter will read the FBX and also load the tank from the PKG files.<br />
The reason TE also loads the tank from the PGKs is so data can be compared to the FBX and find changes.<br />
Also.. the Track part of the Chassis and Visual files are needed to write the prmitive file(s).</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="359"><img src="Images/ask_extract.jpg" alt="Need to Extract?" width="359" height="193" /></td>
    <td width="100%">If this window pops up while inporting a FBX, it simply means that no data exists in the res_mods for the tank you imported.<br />
      In order for Tank Exporter to save primitive files, it needs the folder structure. Also, the game needs a place to load from too.<br />
      If you have NOT set the path to res_mods, you will get a message telling you.<br />
      Click Yes... The Extract widow will popup and you can decide what to extract from there.<br />
      See the Folders and Paths section. <br />
      <span class="style2">DO NOT FORGET TO UPDATE THE res_mods PATH IN TE WHEN THE GAME IS UPDATED!</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><span class="style3">Step 4.</span> <br />
  Once the tank is loaded, flip the view between View Model and View FBX.<br />
  What you are looking for is a difference in the size of the imported FBX and the tank read from the PKG files.<br />
  THEY MUST BE THE SAME SIZE!<br />
  If there is a difference in the size of the two models, you have a scaling issue with your 3D app.<br />
  In 3DS Max you can set this under the top menu item &quot;Customize --&gt; Units Setup..&quot;<br />
  A window will open.. On the top of that window, select &quot;System Unit Setup&quot;.<br />
Set the System Unit Scale to 1 Unit = 1.0 Centimeters and click OK. Max will save this until you change it again.<br />
Clean the scene and re-import the ORIGINAL FBX exported from Tank Exporter. Export the tank with the new scale setting and go back to Step 4.<br />
I can not stress enough how important it is to make sure the scaling is not being changed by your 3D application! <br />
<br />
If you can export a tank.. import it in your 3D app... export it from there as FBX and import it in to Tank Exporter as FBX with not scale problems,,,<br />
CONGRATULATIONS! 
You have completed the first step in setting up to work with FBX in Tank Exporter and your 3D software!<br />
Now lets do some simple editing of a tank! <br />
